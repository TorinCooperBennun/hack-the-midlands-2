# LightCoin

Have you ever wanted a real, physical indication of how much money you're
losing in your investments?

Look no further! LightCoin will flash an actual bona fide **emergency exit
sign** whenever your cryptocurrency of choice crashes in value! The
software even comes with built-in sirens (full volume only!)

## Installation requirements

The software is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi, and requires Python 3
with the following packages:

* RPi.GPIO >= 0.6.3
* requests
* matplotlib
* scipy

Other hardware requirements include a working emergency exit sign, a heavy-duty
relay or triac, and a big ol' transformer...
